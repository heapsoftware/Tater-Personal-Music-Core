# Personal Music Core for Tater

A standalone, unofficial [Tater](https://github.com/TaterTotterson/Tater) core that
gives every Person their own music: link each Person to their own **Emby** user or
their own folder on a **network share** (SMB/CIFS or NFS), then browse and play
their library with voice control, per-person recommendations, and multi-room
playback across clock-synchronized satellites, native Sonos groups, stereo pairs,
and media players.

It is built from Tater_Shop's `music_core.py` (a pure-rename commit plus separate
feature commits), so it can run **side by side** with the stock Music Core —
Redis keys, settings, provider ids, tool ids, and the WebUI tab are all namespaced
away from the original (verified by tests).

## Install

1. Push this repo to GitHub (the manifest CI regenerates `core_manifest.json` on
   every core change).
2. In Tater's **Core Shop**, add this repo's raw manifest URL as an additional
   shop repo (Core Shop → repos / `POST /api/shop/cores/repos`), e.g.
   `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/heapsoftware/Tater-Personal-Music-Core/main/core_manifest.json`.
3. Install **Personal Music Core** from the shop and enable it.

Alternatively, copy `cores/personal_music_core.py` into your Tater `cores/` directory
yourself.

## Music sources

Open Tater → **Personal Music** tab → **Sources**.

**Sources is the single, global music source for the household** — one Emby
login (or API key), or one mounted share folder. This is the library that
People *without* their own link hear, and what the dashboard player bar and
client music use. It is **not** how each Person gets their own library: giving
a Person their own Emby user or share folder is done per-Person in the
**People** section (see [Per-person links](#per-person-links)), which
overrides the global source for that Person only.

### Emby

- **Username & password** (recommended): the core signs in per user, honors each
  Emby user's library access, and streams through this core's own token-gated,
  Range-capable stream server so the Emby token never appears in any URL a
  playback target fetches.
- **Server API key**: streams directly from Emby; set the Emby User ID when the
  server has more than one user.

### Network share (SMB/CIFS or NFS)

Tater does **not** mount shares itself. Mount the share on the Tater **host** (or
bind-mount it into the container), then point the core at the mounted folder:

```yaml
# docker-compose.yml (Tater service)
    volumes:
      - /mnt/music:/mnt/music:ro
```

The core scans the folder with a stdlib tag reader (ID3v2 MP3, FLAC/Vorbis, Ogg
Vorbis/Opus, MP4/M4A, WAV — no extra packages needed), reads embedded or
`cover.jpg`/`folder.jpg` artwork, and streams files with full Range support.

## Per-person links

**Personal Music** tab → **People** → **Add Person Link** (the form opens on
that card; **Edit** on a linked Person's card reopens it). Each Person can get:

- their own Emby user/library on a shared server, or
- their own subfolder on a mounted share (e.g. `/mnt/music/<person>`).

A linked Person gets their own catalog, listening history, AI-named
recommendations, and prompt-ready music profile, scoped under
`personal_music_core:*:<person_id>` keys. Everyone else follows the global source.
Voice requests resolve the speaking Person automatically.

For **Emby (own user/library)**, fill in the Person's card in **People**:

- **Emby Server URL** is pre-filled with the global server from Sources — leave
  it as-is when the Person's account is on the same Emby server (the common
  case); change it only if their account lives on a different server.
- **Emby Username / Password**: that Person's own Emby account. Emby decides
  which libraries that account can see, so their browsing, search, and
  recommendations only draw from libraries their account is allowed to access.
  (An **API key** can be used instead, but an API key sees the server's whole
  library, so per-person accounts are the recommended route.)
- **Test Emby Connection** checks the URL and credentials against Emby without
  saving anything; **Save Person Link** stores the link and immediately loads
  that Person's catalog (if the credentials fail, the save message says so).
- The **password field stays blank on the saved card** — re-enter it only when
  changing it; a blank field keeps the saved password.

### Per-person queues

Every Person also gets their **own playback queue** — the shared household queue
only serves requests where no Person is identified (dashboards, client music,
and the stock-like global path):

- **Independent queues and timelines.** Each Person's queue keeps its own
  current track, position, shuffle/repeat, and continuous-radio state, so two
  People can listen to different music in different rooms at the same time.
- **Follow-me handoff.** "Move my music to the kitchen" (`personal_music_move`)
  hands the stream off to the new room at the same spot in the track. Room
  transport commands ("next", "pause", "stop") act on whatever is playing in
  the speaking room first, then on that Person's own queue.
- **Room bindings.** Bind a room to a Person ("the Kitchen plays my music") via
  the `personal_music_control` tool (`bind_room` / `unbind_room`); bound rooms
  become that Person's default destination.
- **Conflict behavior.** When the rooms someone asks for are already playing
  someone else's music — or their own music is playing elsewhere — each Person
  chooses on their link card (with a global default in settings):
  - **Ask before taking over** (default): Tater asks over TTS and waits for a
    yes/no (or "start the new music instead"); the pending request expires
    after 10 minutes.
  - **Auto-move / take over**: the requested rooms are freed automatically and
    the other queue keeps playing, paused at its position, on any rooms it has
    left.

### View Music As

By default the dashboard tabs (Playlist, Browse Library, Recommendations) show
the household's shared view. **View Music As** switches the whole dashboard to
one linked Person: their own library to browse and search, **their own playback
queue** on the Playlist tab (with its own transport controls), and **their own
AI-named mixes** on the Recommendations tab.

- Reach it from the **View Music As** card on the Browse Library,
  Recommendations, and People tabs, or from **View Their Music** inside a
  Person's link editor (press **Edit** on their card); only linked People are
  offered, plus "Back to Household".
- While viewing, playing from the dashboard goes to **that Person's queue** (and
  records their listening history), and the stats row shows who you're viewing.
- Voice is unaffected — requests always follow the speaking Person.

### Follow-Me presence

Optionally, a linked Person's music can **follow them room to room**. Enable
**Follow-Me Presence** in the core settings, then give the Person a
**Home Assistant Person** entity in their People card (e.g. `person.john`) —
any presence stack works, including BLE trackers that compute the closest node
and update the person entity (Bermuda, ESPHome, phone GPS, …). The core
reuses Tater's built-in Home Assistant integration for the base URL and token
(no separate credentials) and polls HA's REST API for the entity's state,
which is the friendly name of the zone the Person is in.

- **Follows zones, resolves Tater rooms.** When the zone changes and holds for
  the move delay (default 20 s), the Person's queue hands off to that room at
  the same spot in the track — using Tater's room model (which Sat/player is
  in which room). Zone names that differ from Tater room names can be mapped
  per Person with **Zone to Room Overrides** (`The Kitchen=Kitchen, …`).
- **Room takeover is user-selectable.** When the room they walk into is already
  playing someone else's music: **Auto take over** (default) frees the room
  immediately, or **Ask before taking over** asks over TTS in that room and
  waits for the Person's yes/no (expires after 10 minutes, like other
  conflicts). Settable globally in the core settings and per Person on their
  card.
- **Away behavior is user-selectable (3 options).** In a zone with no
  speakers, or when the person is `not_home`:
  - **Keep in dead rooms, pause when away** (default)
  - **Pause whenever they leave a speaker room**
  - **Never pause; only move into rooms**
  A follow-me pause resumes automatically when they reappear in a room with
  speakers, at the same spot in the track.
- **Visibility.** The **Follow-Me Presence** system task shows the last check
  and errors; each Person card shows their current state (e.g. "Follow-me: in
  Kitchen → Kitchen", "paused (away from home)", "person entity not found in
  Home Assistant").

Follow-Me is off by default and requires Tater's Home Assistant integration to
be configured (base URL + token); without it the system task explains what to
enable.

## Settings worth knowing

| Setting | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Stream Server Port | `8621` | Local HTTP port the core serves token-authenticated Emby streams and share files from. Must be reachable from your playback targets on the LAN. |
| Stream Host | auto | Override only if the auto-detected LAN address is wrong (e.g. multiple NICs). |
| Catalog Sync Interval | `900` s | Also drives per-person catalog refreshes. |
| Follow-Me Presence | off | Master switch for following linked People's Home Assistant person entities (see [Follow-Me presence](#follow-me-presence)). |
| Follow-Me Poll Interval | `15` s | How often HA is polled for each tracked Person (5–3600 s). |
| Follow-Me Move Delay | `20` s | How long a new zone must hold before the music moves (prevents hallway flicker). |

## Limitations

- Little Spud client music is not switched over — the Tater host currently links
  client music to the stock `music_core` only, and this core's client music
  surface (`run_client_music_action`, `get_client_music_stream_source`) follows
  the shared household queue, not a Person queue.
- Network-share playback serves original files; there is no on-the-fly transcode
  for mixed sync groups (Emby username sign-in does transcode to WAV when needed).
- Volume and per-target calibrations are shared per destination; two queues
  playing different rooms at once keep their own volume, but the same room's
  calibration is shared.
- By default the dashboard player bar and Playlist tab show the shared
  household queue; per-Person queue state is visible on each Person's card in
  the People section, or dashboard-wide via [View Music As](#view-music-as)
  (one viewer at a time — Tater's WebUI doesn't yet tell cores who is viewing,
  so the core can't scope the dashboard per viewer automatically).
- Follow-Me tracks one zone per Person (their Home Assistant person entity's
  state) and moves the whole queue to the single room that zone resolves to.
  Zones with no matching Tater room are dead zones (handled by the selected
  away action), and Follow-Me reuses Tater's Home Assistant credentials — it
  cannot track a second Home Assistant instance.

## Development

```sh
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests
```

The test suite runs offline (fake Redis, fake Emby server, hand-crafted audio tag
fixtures) and includes coexistence tests that load the upstream `music_core.py`
snapshot alongside this core.

### Keeping in sync with upstream `music_core.py`

The repo history seeds from Tater_Shop with a pure-rename commit, and `upstream`
points at `https://github.com/TaterTotterson/Tater_Shop.git`:

```sh
git fetch upstream
git diff upstream/main:cores/music_core.py cores/personal_music_core.py
```

Port relevant hunks by hand (do not merge — upstream contains shop files this
repo does not carry). The goal is absorbing upstream bug fixes, not staying
byte-identical.
